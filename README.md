# ðŸš€ AnythingLLM Deployment and Application Setup

This repository provides a reproducible and portable setup for deploying the **AnythingLLM** platform using **Docker**, as well as running the associated **FastAPI backend** with **Uvicorn**.  
The setup ensures seamless integration between backend services, frontend interfaces, and external model providers such as **Ollama** or **OpenAI**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Setup of AnythingLLM Using Docker

To efficiently deploy the **AnythingLLM** platform and guarantee environment consistency, **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are used as the primary containerization tools.

Docker encapsulates the entire applicationâ€”including dependencies, configurations, and servicesâ€”into isolated containers.  
This minimizes compatibility issues across different systems and simplifies deployment.

### ðŸ§© Steps

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** on the host machine  
   - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
   - [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Clone the official AnythingLLM repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.git
   cd anything-llm
3. **Configure environment variables**
- Edit the docker-compose.yml in anything-llm/docker
- Modify the .env file in antything-llm/server to suit your setup:
   ```bash
   #Adding this to the end of your .env file
   ENABLE_ADMIN_API=true
   ADMIN_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

4. **Start the application using Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
This command builds and launches all containers in detached mode, running the backend, frontend, and any related services.

5. **Access the web interface**

   - Local access: http://localhost:3001
   - Remote access: http://<HOST_IP>:3001

ðŸ’¡ Using Docker ensures a robust, scalable, and cross-platform setup that simplifies updates and guarantees consistent deployment across environments.

## ðŸ§  2. Cloning the Application Repository from GitHub and Environment Setup
The application source code is hosted on GitHub to ensure version control, collaboration, and reproducibility.

### ðŸ§© Steps
1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThienNguyenMinh1311/TMA_Lab2.git
   cd app
   
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
This ensures that all required Python packages are installed in the environment, matching the development configuration.

3. **(Optional) Configure environment variables**
If the application requires specific configuration, create a .env file and define:
