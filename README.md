# ðŸš€ AnythingLLM Deployment and Application Setup

This repository provides a reproducible and portable setup for deploying the **AnythingLLM** platform using **Docker**, as well as running the associated **FastAPI backend** with **Uvicorn**.  
The setup ensures seamless integration between backend services, frontend interfaces, and external model providers such as **Ollama** or **OpenAI**.

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Setup of AnythingLLM Using Docker

To efficiently deploy the **AnythingLLM** platform and guarantee environment consistency, **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are used as the primary containerization tools.

Docker encapsulates the entire applicationâ€”including dependencies, configurations, and servicesâ€”into isolated containers.  
This minimizes compatibility issues across different systems and simplifies deployment.

### ðŸ§© Steps

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** on the host machine

   - [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Clone the official AnythingLLM repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.git
   cd anything-llm
